Project introduction:
Localization is essential for the application of multirobot systems.
Due to the limitations of on-board resources, the localization algorithm must consider the trade-off between accuracy and actual costs to make the feasible implementations.
In this paper, we consider the optimal measurement scheduling with respect to dynamic topology switching for a group of robots participating in cooperative localization in resource-constrained conditions.
We formulate the novel topology switching problem for CL algorithm and moreover, does not assume full-observability condition for cost-down optimization goal, as opposed to previous work. Next, this problem which is proven to be combinatorial and NP-hard, can be solved approximately by efficient greedy algorithm due to its super-modularity property. 
Finally, the effectiveness of our proposed method is validated through simulations with real-world settings.
